# Person detection example

This example shows how you can use Tensorflow Lite to run a 250 kilobyte neural
network to recognize people in images captured by a camera.  It is designed to
run on systems with small amounts of memory such as microcontrollers and DSPs.
This uses the experimental int8 quantized version of the person detection model.

**重要**：這個還沒做完，還不能使用。

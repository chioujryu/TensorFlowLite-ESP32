# **TensorFlowLite_ESP32_Arduino_Tutorial**

## **Overview**

This library runs TensorFlow machine learning models on microcontrollers, allowing you to build AI/ML applications powered by deep learning and neural networks. 

With the included examples, you can recognize how to train the model, how to deploy AI model to microcontroller.

The examples work best with the ESP32 board.

## **Skills needded**
### **C++**
You need to understand the knowledge of `C++` first, including `object oriented`, if you are not familiar with `C++` you can refer to [
CPlusPlus-Tutorial-of-Blacksmith](https://github.com/chioujryu/CPlusPlus-Tutorial-of-Blacksmith), this C++ tutorial is written in Chinese, if you want to understand C++ English teaching you can refer to ` C++ Primer` This book

### **Python**
Given that implementing deep learning and machine learning typically involves using Python, it's important to have a solid understanding of Python as well.

### **DL, ML Knowledge**
You also need to learn about AI. Since training AI models requires data pre-processing and structuring AI deep neural networks, it is necessary to learn the Python language before delving into AI.

## **Download this repository**
If you are using a Windows system, please follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal.
2. Use the `cd` command to access the Arduino `libraries` folder. This folder is usually located at the default path:
    ```
    C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries
    ```

3. Then, enter the following command to download the necessary files:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/chioujryu/TensorFlowLite-ESP32-Tutorial
    ```

By completing these steps, you should be able to successfully download the required files.

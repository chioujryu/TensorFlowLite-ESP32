# **TensorFlowLite_ESP32_Arduino_Tutorial**

## **Overview**

This library runs TensorFlow machine learning models on microcontrollers, allowing you to build AI/ML applications powered by deep learning and neural networks. 

With the included examples, you can recognize how to train the model, how to deploy AI model to microcontroller.

The examples work best with the ESP32 board.

## **Skills needded**
### **C++**
You need to understand the knowledge of `C++` first, including `object oriented`, if you are not familiar with `C++` you can refer to [
CPlusPlus-Tutorial-of-Blacksmith](https://github.com/chioujryu/CPlusPlus-Tutorial-of-Blacksmith), this C++ tutorial is written in Chinese, if you want to understand C++ English teaching you can refer to ` C++ Primer` This book

### **Python**
Given that implementing deep learning and machine learning typically involves using Python, it's important to have a solid understanding of Python as well.

### **DL, ML Knowledge**
You also need to learn about AI. Since training AI models requires data pre-processing and structuring AI deep neural networks, it is necessary to learn the Python language before delving into AI.

## **Examples**

### Hello World
Here's a basic tutorial, step by step, you'll learn how TensorFlow Lite works.

## **Download this File**
You can open the terminal and navigate to the Arduino library folder using the following command:
```
cd C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries
```
Then, clone the file from the following GitHub repository into the Arduino library folder using the git clone command:
```
git clone https://github.com/chioujryu/TensorFlowLite-ESP32-Tutorial
```


## **Deploy to ESP32**
If you want to learn how to build an ESP32 environment, you can refer to the following link [Deploy to ESP32](examples\01_hello_world_sinewave\README.md)
